    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>Payment/Requesting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><mark>Ko-fi + Paypal only!! No refunds!</mark></li>
        <li>I only accept payments in <u>USD</u> at the moment.</li>
        <li>All payments are paid upfront.</li>
        <li>I'd prefer if you give me a description of the commission before paying, but you have 3 days to pay before I turn down the offer. <mark>Do not ghost me.</mark></li>
        <li>If there are outside circumstances preventing you from doing the above, do explain it beforehand.</li>
        <li><mark>It's best to send me references</mark> of your character and/or draw a quick sketch of what you expect your desired commission to look like. It helps me improve my art by a margin!</li>
        <li><mark>You may <i>not</i> use my art for AI or NFT/crypto-related purposes.</mark></li>
        <li>You may order at most <u>two</u> artworks of the same character a year. This is to prevent oversaturation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Posting/Uploading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I reserve the right to use the final piece however I want, and I will always mention the person who commissioned me. Only exception is if the commissioner wants to stay anonymous.</li>
        <li>Commercial use is not allowed.</li>
        <li>You can post your commission anywhere, as long as you <mark>credit me and don't remove my watermark.</mark></li>
