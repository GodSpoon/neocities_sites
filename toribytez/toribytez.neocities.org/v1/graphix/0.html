    <p style="margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:5px;">Most of these graphics aren't actually mine! I took these from various sites such as other Neocities, Tumblr, Rentry, and DeviantArt. If you're the rightful owner of these graphics and you want them taken down, please shoot me an email here:<br>

    With that being said, do keep in mind that this is a <b style="color:#de0000">photosensitivity/eyestrain warning</b>, so enter at your own risk.
