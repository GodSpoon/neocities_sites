    <p style="margin-top: -7px; margin-bottom: 1px;"><i>Punishments may vary depending on the situation.</i></p>
    <ul style="list-style:square; margin-top: 1px;">
        <li><u>1-month blacklists</u> include ghosting me (such as failing to submit a payment within 3 days, or failure to respond to any of my DMs). (First-time only)</li>
        <li>When you get temporarily blacklisted, you can still donate. You just cannot commission me until the duration of your blacklist expires.</li>
        <li>After the expiration, you will be on a leniency; repeated offenses will result in harsher punishments.</li>
        <li>Misusing your commission (such as removing my watermark or profiting off of my work), violating your blacklist duration, and "prank/troll commissions" will get you <u>permanently blacklisted</u>, meaning a hardblock on all of my socials.</li>
        <li>If your name is on the blacklist as a preemptive measure, then <u>you're permanently not allowed to interact.</u> It means you've made me feel extremely uncomfortable.</li>
    </ul>
